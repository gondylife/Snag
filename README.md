##What's this?

This is an experiment on detecting spam SMS with Naive Bayes classifier. You can read about it: [kehers.github.com/2014/09/07/building-an-sms-spam-filter.html](http://kehers.github.com/2014/09/07/building-an-sms-spam-filter.html)

##Shouldn't this be an auto-filter on mobile?

That's where this is going. This page is just a test ground. To be notified once available on mobile, subscribe here: [tinyletter.com/kehers](https://tinyletter.com/kehers)

##And who are you?

My name is [Opeyemi Obembe](http://kehers.github.io/). I am just another guy that loves building things.

##"Snag" though...

Yeah. I am that bad at naming things.
